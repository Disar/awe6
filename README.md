`awe6` is `game` inverted: a scalable, flexible and intuitive framework for the rapid development of [quality games](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/Showcase).

Adopting an inversion-of-control + entity-component concept awe6 comes with both [big ideas and batteries included](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/): [assets](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/Component-Assets), [inputs](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/Component-Inputs), [audio](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/Component-Audio), [session](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/Component-Session), [scenes](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/Component-Scene) and [preloading](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/Component-Preloader) are handled "out of the box" using the templates provided.

[Why?](https://github.com/hypersurge/awe6/wiki/Developer-Benefits) Because games need components, components need structure, structures need frames.  awe6 is a game framework api: populate it with components, systems and gameplay.
